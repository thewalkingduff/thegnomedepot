# THE GNOME DEPOT

The Gnome Depot is a Spring Boot MVC e-commerce app that utilizes MySQL on the backend and Thymeleaf to provide the View.

# Main User Features:
<h6>A User can:</h6>
<ul>
    <li>register an account</li>
    <li>log in</li>
    <li>view products</li>
    <li>search for a products</li>
    <li>add products to cart</li>
    <li>view similar products to the ones that are already in their cart</li>
    <li>checkout and receive order confirmation</li>
   
</ul>

# Tech Stack and Accomplishments:
The Gnome Depot is a Java Spring Boot application that uses a MySql database. Technologies include:

<ul>
    <li>Spring Web</li>
    <li>Thymeleaf</li>
    <li>Spring Security</li>
    <li>Spring Validation</li>
    <li>Mockito, a java based mocking framework, and JUnit for testing</li>
    <li>Lombok</li>
</ul>

<h6>Most of the front end was written from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Thymeleaf.  The layouts on Amazon, Target and The Home Depot inspire the front-end design.  For example, if you view Amazon's checkout page, my checkout page looks very similar to it.  I considered it a challenge to make my checkout page look like it, and I'm happy with the results.</h6>
<h6>I added a "Product related to items in your cart" container on the cart page that I think is pretty cool.  I also created the "THE GNOME DEPOT" logo from scratch on Canva.</h6>
<h6>Adding the ability for the user to choose the number of items was challenging but was a must-have feature for an e-commerce website.</h6>
